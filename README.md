# 🔍 Smart Contract Audit Reports

Welcome to my Smart Contract Security Audit repository. This repository serves as a centralized location for all my audit findings, vulnerability research, and code review reports on various decentralized applications (dApps), protocols, and Solidity-based smart contracts.

I leverage industry-standard tools and manual analysis techniques to ensure secure and reliable code, with a strong focus on DeFi, NFT protocols, and permissionless infrastructure.

## 🧠 About Me

I am a smart contract security researcher and blockchain developer with hands-on experience auditing and testing Ethereum-based contracts using both automated and manual techniques. I’ve completed the **Cyfrin Updraft Smart Contract Security Auditing Program** and regularly work with tools such as:

- [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither)
- [Aderyn](https://github.com/fergarrui/aderyn)
- [Solodit](https://www.solodit.xyz/)

- Foundry (`forge test`, `forge fuzz`, `forge coverage`)
- Manual auditing and exploit simulation
